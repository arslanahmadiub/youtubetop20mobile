      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      <p>
        We have developed an unique algorithm which by default calculates the
        Top 20 (YouTube) videos viewed globally over the last 24 hours, and the
        Hottest Top 20 (YouTube) videos that have just been released, globally.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, our database can be searched by Date, Region, and Subject
        letting the viewer discover many Top 20 and Hot 20 variations, including
        the Top 20 Music, Sports, News videos and many more. Furthermore, YTT20
        lets you search YouTube’s 103 Regions, Globally or Individually. So you
        can take the time to find out what’s popular in different regions of the
        world. Lastly, you can search by Date, which means in the future
        GlobalTop20.com can be like a time-machine, letting you go back and view
        what was popular on a specific day in history. You can easily track
        what’s going on now, or see what people were watching on your birthday,
        for example.

          lists have in the past been popularized in with Billboard, VH1, MTV,
          or Radio countdowns, and millions of internet listicles, but (to the
          best of our knowledge) this is the first time a count down using our
          calculation for YouTube has been done. 1m 18s
